The system will feature a natural user interface allowing to upload diverse invoice formats, including scanned images and digital documents. Key data fields such as invoice numbers, dates, product details, and amounts will be accurately extracted, promoting efficiency in data entry processes.

  - **Technologies Used:**
  - **Programming Language:** Python
  - **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, Open CV, OCR
  - **Data Manipulation and Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
  - **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model Building
  - **Model Deployment:** streamlit, flask

- **Objectives:**
  1. Automate the extraction of essential information from retail receipts or invoices to streamline data capture processes.
  2. Ensure high accuracy and robustness in extracting item details, prices, dates, and other relevant data from various store bill formats.
  3. Develop scalability to efficiently handle large transaction volumes while seamlessly integrating with existing business workflows and software applications.
  4. Enable the storage of extracted data in a tabular format, facilitating analysis for accounting, billing, and inventory management purposes.
  5. Support forecasting of future customer trends through comprehensive data analysis, aiding in strategic decision-making processes.

     factors.
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and uncover potential correlations with sales.
 3. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and any necessary encoding of categorical variables, Prepare the data for model training by scaling or normalizing features as needed.
 4. Model Development:
    
    1)Decision Tree Model:
      - Implement a Decision Tree model to predict sales based on the identified attributes.
      - Tune hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
      - Evaluate the Decision Tree model's accuracy and interpretability.
      
    2)Random Forest Model:
      - Build a Random Forest model to enhance the predictive capabilities of the Decision Tree.
      - Evaluate and compare the performance of the Random Forest model against the Decision Tree.
        
 5. Insights and Recommendations: Explore the importance of different attributes in influencing sales by analyzing feature importance scores from the models.


- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Programming Language:** Python
  - **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-Learn
  - **Data Manipulation and Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
  - **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used for model development and analysis

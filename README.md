üë©‚Äçüíª Shubham bhujade Data Science Portfolio : 

Welcome to my data science journey! I am a passionate data science student eager to explore the vast world of data. Below, you'll find a collection of my projects, skills, and learning experiences.

üöÄ Projects
1] Build a machine learning classification model to assist in income categorization:

- **Description:** This project aims to predict whether an individual's salary is less than $50,000 or greater than $50,000 based on various demographic and employment features. It involves the development of a machine learning classification model to assist in income categorization.

- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Programming Language:** Python
  - **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-Learn
  - **Data Manipulation and Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
  - **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model Building

- **Objectives:**
  1. **Data Collection:** Gather a comprehensive dataset containing information on individuals, including different-different features
  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the characteristics of the dataset. This involves visualizing the 
     distributions of key features
  3. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle any missing values, outliers, or necessary encoding of variables.   
  4. **Model Development:** Implement the Naive Bayes classification algorithm using the training dataset.
  5. **Model Evaluation :** Interpret the model's predictions and evaluate its generalization to unseen data.
  6. **Insights and Recommendations:** Apply the trained Naive Bayes model to predict salary categories for new or unseen data.

2] Delivery Time Prediction Model

- **Description:** This project involves building a Simple Linear Regression model to understand the relationship between the time taken for sorting items and the time taken for the actual delivery in a logistics company. The goal is to predict the delivery time based on the sorting time, enabling the company to optimize its operations.

- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Programming Language:** Python
  - **Machine Learning Library:** Scikit-Learn
  - **Data Manipulation and Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
  - **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development
  - **GitHub:** Version control and collaboration

- **Project Objectives:**
  1. **Data Collection:** Gather data on sorting time and corresponding delivery time for a set of deliveries.
  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the relationship between sorting time and delivery time through visualizations and statistical analysis.
  3. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle any missing values, outliers, or necessary encoding of variables.
  4. **Model Development:** Build a Simple Linear Regression model to predict delivery time based on sorting time.
  5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and validate its accuracy.
  6. **Insights and Recommendations:** Provide insights into the relationship between sorting and delivery time and suggest potential optimizations for the logistics 
       process.
